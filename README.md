# PINNs-for-building-thermal-modeling-and-Demand-Response
a novel framework based on a physics-informed neural network dubbed as PhysCon that combines the interpretable ability of physical laws and the expressive power of neural networks for control-oriented demand response of grid-integrated buildings. 

We thanks for Dr. Gargya Gokhale provided basic code source of the PINNs structure.
